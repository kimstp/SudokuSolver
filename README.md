# SudokuSolver
My attempt at a Sudoku solver using sets.

## Requirements
* CMake >= ver. 3.19
* A C++11 compiler like clang or gcc 

## Build
To build the solver at the test do
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This builds three targets `sudoku`, `testset`, and `testsudoku`.

Enjoy!
